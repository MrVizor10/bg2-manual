            <header>The Main Interface:
                Where the Game is Played</header>
            <article>
                <p>Here is the main screen that you will use when navigating the world of Baldur’s Gate. On the
                    left side of the screen are several buttons:</p>
                <img src="./images/bg2 main screen.png">
                <li>Game Screen</li>
                <li>Map Screen</li>
                <li>Journal</li>
                <li>Inventory</li>
                <li>Character Record</li>
                <li>Mage Spells</li>
                <li>Priest Spells</li>
                <li>Options</li>
                <li>Rest</li>
                <li>Clock (Pause/Unpause)</li>
                <p>On the right side of the screen, below the character portraits, are some additional buttons:</p>
                <li>Select Tool (touchscreens only)</li>
                <li>Help Tool (touchscreens only)</li>
                <li>Select All</li>
                <li>Party AI On/Off</li>
                <p>You are also able to configure the main interface to match your play style, minimizing sections
                    of the interface that you do not use often (or with hot keys you have mastered). At the top of the
                    right and left side panels are buttons that minimize each side panel. When a panel is minimized,
                    a button appears in the corresponding bottom corner of the screen; this button will bring the
                    panel back up. You can also use the “u” hot key to hide the entire interface or reset the interface
                    as needed. You can change the hot keys in the Gameplay section of the Options screen, under
                    “Assign Keys.”</p>

                <p>You can zoom in with the camera to get a closer look at the action by scrolling your mouse
                    wheel down, or zoom out to get a view of a larger area by scrolling your mouse wheel up.</p>

            <header>Pausing the Game</header>
            <article>
                <p>You can pause the game at any time by either hitting the space bar on your keyboard or
                    pressing the clock button on the bottom left of the screen. This is a very important part of
                    gameplay, as combat will often become unmanageable in real time. When this happens, you can
                    simply pause the game, assign orders to your characters, then unpause and let the action unfold.</p>
                <p><em>Note: During combat, you will not be able to equip or unequip your character’s armor. You can,
                        however, change the weapons and other protective items you have equipped, such as shields,
                        amulets, rings, or cloaks</em></p>

            <article>
                <p>The red diamond-shaped button on the bottom of the screen, to the left of the action icons,
                    toggles a display that shows all items in the immediate vicinity that are on the ground. Clicking
                    on any one of these items will move the currently selected character (or the leader of the
                    selected group) to that item and move it to that character’s inventory. Gold will be picked up
                    immediately without needing to move.</p>

            <header>Auto-Pausing</header>
            <article>
                <p>You can set the game to pause automatically during gameplay. To access the auto-pause options,
                    open the Options screen, then the Gameplay screen, and choose “Auto-Pause.” By configuring
                    more auto-pause parameters, you can make the game take on a more turn-based feel.</p>

                <p>Note that the cursor changes when moved over objects or characters or NPCs to indicate the
                    default action. The default action mode can be changed by L-clicking on the buttons in the

            <article>
                <p>The cursor changes when moved over objects or characters or NPCs to indicate the default
                    action. The default action mode can be changed by L-clicking the buttons at the bottom of the
                    screen.</p>
                <p>If a given cursor is selected, it may be changed by selecting a different action button, by R-
                    clicking somewhere on the screen, or by L-clicking somewhere on the screen where the cursor
                    has no effect (for example, a non-object or the interface border)</p>
                <p>Here are the icons, and their descriptions, for the cursors that will appear during play.</p>
