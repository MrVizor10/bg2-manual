            <header>Multiplayer</header>
            <p>The multiplayer game is identical to the single player game—at least in terms of the game’s
                content. The main differences between the single and multiplayer games relate to who is
                playing in the game; in the single player game, you create one character and through the course
                of your adventure up to five NPCs join you. After they join, they are fully under your control. In
                a multiplayer game, between one and six players adventure together, cooperatively controlling
                both created characters and NPCs that join the party.</p>
            <p>A few definitions are in order. The leader is the player who has control over such things as who
                can join, what kinds of characters can be brought into the game, and what abilities the players
                who are in the game actually have (in terms of gameplay; see Permissions, below). The leader
                can control one or more characters in the game and has the ability to assign characters to the
                other players. The server is the computer (usually, but not necessarily, the leader’s computer),
                which coordinates the various game states of the client machines of each player. A player is one
                of the people who control one or more characters in the game. A character is an alter ego,
                analogous to the characters of the single player game, which is controlled by one player in a
                multiplayer session.</p>

                        are assigned control of character slots and create
                        the characters that they will role-play in the
                        game. From this screen, the leader also controls
                        permissions and other options for the game. The
                        player running the server is initially assigned as
                        the leader of the party. As the session’s host, he or
                        she has the ability to assign character slots to the
                        players who are in the session. This is achieved by
                        L-clicking on the player name slots, after which a
                        panel will pop up with the names of all players currently in the session. Control of a slot may be
                        assigned to any player, who can then use the Character Arbitration screen to load a character
                        into that slot. This is done by clicking on the Create Character button. Players may either import
                        an existing character or create an entirely new character, just as if starting a new single player
                        game.

            <p>As in the single player game, there is one character who is the protagonist of the story. If this
                character dies, the game is over and must be reloaded as in the single player game. The
                protagonist in the multiplayer session will be the character in the first character slot on the
                Character Arbitration screen.</p>

        <section>
            <header>Characters</header>
            <p>The characters in multiplayer may be created from scratch or imported into the game using the
                “Import” button. The character is created using the exact same screens as in the single player
                game, subject to the restrictions set by the leader of the session in the Player Permissions
                submenu.</p>
            <p>Once a character is created, it can be modified by clicking on the player name, which brings up a
                window allowing the player to create, import, export, or delete it (the active character must be
                deleted before Create and Import options are available, and the Export and Delete options are
                available only when there is a character in the slot).</p>
            <p>When the player is satisfied with the character, he or she clicks on the large checkmark icon to
                the right of the character slot to “lock” the character and prevent changes. If a player wishes to
                change a character, that character must be “unlocked” by clicking on this icon again.</p>

                experience points and levels); or Stats, XP, and Items. By choosing one of these settings, the
                leader limits the types of characters that can be brought into the multiplayer session from the
                single player game or other multiplayer sessions. You can also select an option to display

            <p>Also on the Permissions screen is an option, “Listen to Join Requests,” which allows the leader to
                listen to requests to join the session or to turn off requests if there are enough players in the
                game. For example, the leader might only want to have one or two people in the game, so
                having people requesting to join could get annoying. An interesting facet of multiplayer is that
                the player creating the session can choose to play solo. The advantage to this is that all
                characters in the party can then be created from scratch.</p>
            <p><em>Note: While we specifically included this option due to popular request, we actually recommend

                when you initiate dialogue with them, only you will be able to view their dialogue. Other players
                will be able to continue playing. The characters that do not pause the game are usually townsfolk, shopkeepers, and other non-critical NPCs. The characters that do pause the game are
                crucial to the plot.Note: if you enable</p>
            <p><em>Note: if you enable the option in Permissions to pause the game and show dialogue for all

        <section>
            <header>General Notes</header>
            <p>When you are playing a multiplayer session, keep in mind the following notes:</p>
            <h4>Asynchronous</h4>
            <p>Baldur’s Gate is an asynchronous game. If you happen to be playing with somebody whose
                system is very close by, you still might see slightly different things happen on each system. T he
                point to remember is that while things happen somewhat differently, the result of the actions is
                always the same.</p>
            <h4>Explorable Area</h4>
            <p>When playing a multiplayer game of Baldur’s Gate, you are limited to exploring one area in the
                game at a time. That is, the characters in the game can spread out only within the same
                aboveground area. While they can enter structures and underground areas individually, they
                cannot travel to other above-ground areas until all characters are ready to do so. These moments
                are marked by a message: “You must gather your party before venturing forth.”</p>
            <h4>Party Gold</h4>
            <p>Just as in the single player game, all gold is shared between members of the party.</p>
            <h4>Shared Experience</h4>
            <p>Just as in the single player game, all characters in the party share in the awarding of experience
                points.</p>
            <h4>The Leader is in Charge</h4>
            <p>In case you haven’t figured it out by now, the leader has control over everything that the player
                can do in the game, including kicking them out and reassigning their characters to other
                players. Make sure that the leader is playing the type of multiplayer game that you want to play.
                That is to say, if you want a hacked game, join that kind of game or start it up; if you want a
                clean game according to AD&D rules—without interference from hacked or edited characters or
                players who don’t want to play as a team—then you need to find players who want the same.</p>
            <h4>User Mods</h4>
            <p>If one player in a session is using a particular user-created mod, all players in the session must
                use the same mod configuration.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <header>iPad Controls</header>
            <p>If you are playing Baldur’s Gate on an iPad, many of the specific controls will work differently
                because you are using a touchscreen instead of a mouse. As a general rule:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Any action requiring an L-click can be accomplished with a tap</li>
                <li>Any action requiring an L-click and drag can be accomplished by merely dragging</li>
                <li>Any action requiring an R-click can be accomplished with a held tap</li>
                <li>Zooming in and out is as simple as pinching, just like in any other iPad app</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition, there are two buttons in the bottom right panel, Select Tool and Help Tool, which
                are designed specifically for iPad users:</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <header>Select Tool</header>
            <p>After selecting this tool, the next touch on the screen will be a selection box; otherwise, touching
                the screen moves the currently selected characters to the target area.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <header>Help Tool</header>
            <p>Selecting this tool briefly highlights all objects on the screen that can be manipulated, such as
                chests, doors, or items on the ground. The current hit point totals for your party members will
                also be displayed above their heads. (PC and Mac users can accomplish this by holding down the
                Tab key.)</p>
