                <p>When you start a new game, either by yourself or
                    with one or more friends, you must first create
                    your character. You can choose your gender, race,
                    class, appearance, and skills, as well as a portrait
                    that will help identify your character in the game.
                    This section will walk you through the process of
                    creating a new character. When you have
                    completed each section, press “Done” to proceed
                    to the next section. </p>
                <p>You can also import a character or use a pre-made
                    character by pressing the “Import” button. You can choose whether to import from a character
                    file or from a saved game. </p>
            </article>

        <section>
            <header>Gender</header>
            <article>
                <p>This is an aesthetic choice and does not affect your attributes in any fashion. It can, however,
                    affect whether or not an NPC becomes romantically interested in your character. Use the gender
                    symbols to select your gender </p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section>
            <header>Portrait</header>
            <article>
                <p>Once you have selected your character’s gender, you will be prompted to choose a portrait to
                    represent your character visually in the game. You will be given a list of options based on the
                    gender you chose; use the buttons provided to scroll left or right to see the available choices.
                </p>
                <p>The dimensions and naming format required for player portraits are:</p>
                <li>XXXXXXXS.bmp (54x84, 200 dpi)</li>
                <li>XXXXXXXM.bmp (169x266, 200 dpi)</li>
                <li>XXXXXXXL.bmp (210x330, 200 dpi)</li>
                <p>For multiplayer, all players must have a copy of the portraits being used; if a portrait is
                    missing
                    on one or more players’ computers, they will see a silhouette with a question mark where the
                    player’s missing portrait should be.</p>

            <header>Race</header>
            <article>
                <p>Select the race of your character. You can choose from any one of the following: human, dwarf,
                    elf, gnome, halfling, half-elf, or half-orc. Descriptions of each race appear in the area to the
                    right
                    of the selection boxes. </p>

            <header>Class</header>
            <article>
                <p>The classes and class combinations available to the race you have chosen will be highlighted.
                    Choose the class that you want from the list. Descriptions of each class are noted in the area
                    to
                    the right of the selection boxes. </p>
                <p>Multi-class characters are available only to non-humans and share the traits and restrictions of
                    both classes. Human characters cannot multi-class but may choose to dual-class later in the
                    game. Only human characters can become dual-class characters.</p>

            <header>Kits</header>
            <article>
                <p>Certain classes (all except Barbarian, Monk, and Sorcerer) also have several “kits” that may be
                    chosen. When you pick one of these classes, you will be given a subset of kits to choose from.
                    If
                    you don’t wish to use a kit, simply choose the default kit (named after the class).</p>
                <p>Kits give special advantages and disadvantages to their parent class. For example, if you choose
                    a
                    “Kensai” kit (a Fighter kit), your character deals more damage with his weapon than any other
                    class in the game. However, your character is unable to use armor or missile weapons.</p>

            <header>Alignment</header>
            <article>
                <p>Once you have selected a race and a class, you will be prompted to select the alignment for your
                    character. Your choices will be limited based on the class you chose; Paladins, for example
                    (with
                    the exception of Blackguards), must be lawful good.</p>
                <p>Your alignment determines how your character interacts with his environment. Read over each
                    alignment’s description (listed in
                    Mastering Melee & Magic) carefully before choosing. If you
                    stray severely from your alignment during the course of the game, there will be consequences—
                    you may even suffer the loss of some of your abilities!</p>

            <header>Ability Scores</header>
            <article>
                <p>You’ll see a screen with the abilities the computer has randomly determined for your character,
                    calculated as if you rolled three 6-sided dice for each ability, adjusted based on race. Any
                    roll
                    that yields a score that is below a class or race’s minimum will be rerolled. You can subtract
                    points away from an ability to add them to another ability; however, you cannot take points away
                    from an ability if it will lower the ability below racial or class minimums. Each ability has a
                    caption describing it.</p>
                <p>You may use the “Reroll” button to generate new numbers for all your ability scores; reroll as
                    many times as you like until you reach a combination you are happy with.</p>

            <header>Skills</header>
            <article>
                <p>Once you have assigned your ability scores, you must choose your skills and proficiencies.
                    Which skills and how many proficiencies you receive is determined by your class; a Mage, for
                    example, must select which spells appear in his spellbook, and a Thief must assign skill points
                    to
                    thieving abilities. Warrior classes only select weapon proficiencies, but receive more of them
                    than any other class.</p>

            <header>Thief Abilities</header>
            <article>
                <p>If your character is a Thief or a multi-class character with Thief abilities, you must allocate
                    ability points to Thief skills. The Thief has 40 points to allocate at the beginning of the game
                    and receives 25 points every level thereafter (although certain Thief kits may alter this
                    number).</p>

            <header>Spells</header>
            <article>
                <p>If your character is a Mage or Sorcerer, you will see a screen where you can choose spells for
                    your spellbook (for a Mage) or personal knowledge (for a Sorcerer). There is also a “PICK FOR
                    ME” button that will select your spells for you. If you are a Specialist Mage (such as an
                    Illusionist or Conjurer), you must select at least one spell from your school of specialization.
                </p>
                <p>Once you have selected your spells, you will also be prompted to select which spells your
                    character has memorized at the start of the game. This will allow you to start adventuring
                    without needing to rest first.</p>

            <header>Weapon Proficiencies</header>
            <article>
                <p>All characters receive weapon proficiencies. The proficiency list appears with a descriptive
                    caption in the bottom right section of the screen. Characters can often wield weapons without
                    the
                    appropriate proficiency, but they incur penalties on all rolls with that weapon. Fighters,
                    Paladins, and Rangers can become even more skilled with weapons by adding a second slot to
                    any proficiency. Doing so gives them an added bonus to their attack rolls and to the damage
                    they inflict. Only Fighters and certain kits can devote more than two slots to a single weapon.
                    Rangers also begin the game with two free proficiency slots assigned to Two-Weapon Style,
                    which gives them the ability to wield two weapons effectively.</p>

                <p>Rangers must choose a racial enemy. The Ranger receives a +4 THAC0 bonus when fighting
                    creatures of this type. You can choose your racial enemy from a list of monsters you are likely
                    to
                    face during your adventures on the Sword Coast; choose the one you hate the most.</p>

                    returning to an earlier section will force you to repeat later sections from scratch—including
                    any ability scores you rolled. If you are satisfied with your character, press “Accept” to start
