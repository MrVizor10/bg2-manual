                    <p id="picsRMBText"> The Inventory screen can either be accessed by L-clicking the Inventory button on the left panel
                        or by R-clicking a character portrait. Some of the screen is taken up by the “paper doll” representation of the character. Along the bottom
                        of the screen are the character’s personal
                        inventory and the encumbrance of the character.
                        Items can be dragged and dropped on the paper
                        doll to be equipped or dragged and dropped on
                        other characters’ portraits to give them the items.
                        Stackable items can be unstacked by double L-
                        clicking on the item. Unstacked items can be
                        stacked by dragging and dropping them on top of
                        one another. Items placed in the Ground slots on
                        the right will be dropped at the character’s feet and can be picked up from the main game area.
                        The group pool of gold is shown on this page as well.
                        </p>
                    <p>Blue-shaded items are magical and unidentified. Red-shaded items are not usable by that
                        character</p>

            <p>Each character has a maximum weight they can carry. The weight currently carried by a
                character is shown to the left of their inventory. Maximum carry weight is determined by the
                Strength attribute of a character. If this weight is exceeded, the character will slow or completely
                stop depending on how overloaded they are.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <header>The Paper Doll</header>
            <p>There are 12 distinct areas in the equipped items section: Helm, armor, bracers or gauntlets,
                cloak, amulet, left ring, right ring, boots, weapons (2 slots for non-warriors, 3 slots for warriors, 4
                slots for fighters), the quiver (up to 3 slots of ammunition), and the shield slot (left hand).</p>
            <p><em>Note: You can also place weapons in your shield slot to wield two weapons. However, if you are
                not proficient in Two-Weapon Style, you will incur severe penalties to your main hand and off-
                hand attack rolls.</em></p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <header>Quick Weapon Slots</header>
            <p>The weapons put into the quick weapon slots determine the quick attacks that are available.
                These slots are like a bandolier of weapons available. For a Mage, this could hold a dagger; for a Fighter, it could be a crushing weapon to use against undead, a bow for distant encounters, and a
                sharp edged weapon for close combat. When a new weapon is put into the weapon slots on the
                Inventory screen, it generates a default quick attack in the quick attack button for this character
                at the bottom of the main interface screen. Only one bow or crossbow may be equipped at a
                time.</p>
            <p>A shield may be equipped only if no two-handed weapons are present in the weapon slots. If a
                two-handed weapon is in one of these slots, the shield is not equipable and a message to this
                effect appears in the inventory message line: “Cannot equip (two-handed weapon in use).” A
                similar message is displayed if a shield is equipped and the player tries to equip a two-handed
                weapon: “Cannot equip (shield in use).”</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <header>Quick Item Slots</header>
            <p>These are slots available to each player that represent miscellaneous items that are kept at the
                ready (potions, for example). These items can be easily accessed during combat, similar to Quick
                Weapon slots.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <header>Personal Inventory</header>
            <p>Considered your “backpack,” you can carry only 16 different items or stacks of items, regardless
                of your encumbrance.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <header>Item Property</header>
            <p>If an item is R-clicked, the view changes to the Item Property page. This page contains the item’s
                icon, description, and picture. Characters with high Lore scores will automatically be able to
                identify certain magical items. If the item is currently unidentified, there will be a button to
                allow you to try to magically identify it. Potions may be consumed from this page (note that the
                potion’s effects will not occur until you have returned to the main game screen). If the item is a
                scroll, wizards will have the opportunity to try to “Write Magic” and add the scroll spell to their
                spellbook. Certain magical items may even have special “Abilities” that can be accessed from
                this page—including the ability to configure the item’s magical powers.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <header>Character Appearance</header>
            <p>Clicking on the colored boxes will allow you to pick from a palette of colors for your character’s
                clothing.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <header>Gem Bags and Scroll Cases</header>
            <p>Gem bags and scroll cases can be bought in stores or found while adventuring. These items are
                used to store multiple gems and scrolls, respectively, and thus free up inventory space. To use
                these bags and cases, simply R-click on the bag or case. Now press the “Open Container” button
                to move to the next screen. From this screen, you can move your gems or scrolls from the right
                hand column to the left hand column. This will move these items into your gem bag or scroll
                case. You can also drag a gem or scroll to the appropriate container in the Personal Inventory
                section to deposit it in the bag or case.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <header>Character Record and Associated Screens</header>
            <p>The Character Record screen shows all of the vital statistics and abilities of the currently
                selected character</p>
            <header>Dual-Class</header>
            <p>This button is only available for human characters with the required classes and ability scores;
                after 2nd level, you can use this convert such a character to dual-class. When you do this, a dual-
                class interface screen will come up from which you can choose the new class for the selected
                character. Characters not allowed dual-class status include Bards, Paladins, Sorcerers, Monks,
                and Barbarians. The character must have at least a 15 in the prime requisite for the character’s
                first class and at least a 17 in the prime requisite for the character’s second class (for instance, a
                Thief wishing to become a Mage must have at least a 15 in Dexterity and at least a 17 in
                Intelligence)</p>
            <p>The dual-class page is very similar to the character generation page—and in fact, making a
                character dual-classed can be seen as essentially starting a character over. A new dual-classed
                character starts with only the 1st-level abilities and restrictions of his new class, though he retains
                his hit point total from his prior class. After a character becomes dual-classed, he can only use
                the abilities of his new class until he surpasses the level of his original class, at which point he
                can freely use the abilities of either class. No further advancement is ever allowed in the first
                class; all further development is in the new class.</p>
            <p><em>Note: You are only allowed to have one kit in Baldur’s Gate. When you first create your
                character, you choose his or her kit. When you dual-class your character, you do NOT get to
                choose a new kit.</em></p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <header>Level Up</header>
            <p>This button is dimmed until the player gains enough experience points to gain a level (this is
                indicated on the portrait by a “+” symbol). When the player clicks the “Level Up” button, the
                Level Up screen will be shown. For a Thief or Monk, the player must distribute new thieving
                points. Sorcerers must select new spells known. A new proficiency slot requires a player to
                choose a weapon class or style to improve. Changes such as modifiers to your THAC0, saving
                throws, and so on will also be displayed here upon leveling up.</p>

            <p>This page allows you to change a character’s appearance, voice, clothing colors, or scripts (the
                computer code that controls behaviors and reactions to environment). Each script also includes a
                description of the script’s effects.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <header>Export</header>
            <p>This allows you to save a “snapshot” of the character’s file to your computer for use in a
                multiplayer game or a new game. The character’s current status will be saved, including hit
                points, experience points, level, class, inventory, and so on.</p>

        <section>
            <header>Wizard and Priest Spell Screens</header>
            <p>The known spells of the wizard or priest are shown in the top section. If you R-click on a spell
                icon, a display page will come up with a spell description. To memorize a spell, L-click on it. The
                spell appears in the field at the bottom of the screen in the Memorized area, but remains shaded
                (and unusable) until the character has had a chance to rest. Every time the caster sleeps, they
                will memorize the spells in this area. If the memorized spell area is full and you want to
                memorize a different spell, L-click on one of the currently memorized spells and it will vanish.</p>
            <p><em>Note: For Sorcerers, only known spells are shown. Sorcerers use a point-based magic system and
                do not need to memorize spells.</em></p>
        </section>

            <header>Options</header>
            <p>This screen allows you to save, load, or quit your game as well as configure gameplay, sound, or

        <section>
            <header>Save, Load, and Quit</header>
            <p>These allow you to save games to your hard disk, discard your current game and load a

                    <p>Brightness and Contrast allows you to adjust the
                        brightness and contrast of the display. You can

            <p>This menu allows you to independently adjust the
                volumes of various sounds in the game. Selecting
                “Character Sounds” allows you to toggle on or off
                some specific sound effects and set the frequency with which your characters verbally respond to

            <header>Gameplay</header>
            <h4>Assign Keys</h4>
            <p>Selecting this button allows you to change the hot keys used during gameplay. The default hot
                keys are listed in the table at the end of this guide. (You can assign additional hot keys for
                specific spells; the default hot keys do not assign these actions automatically.)</p>
            <h4>Tooltip Delay</h4>
            <p>This adjusts how quickly the wizard tooltip appears. The left of the slider is the briefest period of
                time. Note: you can always make the tooltip appear instantly by hitting the “Tab” key on your
                keyboard.</p>
            <h4>Mouse Scroll Speed</h4>
            <p>This adjusts how quickly the screen scrolls across the game world when the mouse is at the edge
                of the screen.</p>    
            <h4>Keyboard Scroll Speed</h4>
            <p>This adjusts how quickly the screen scrolls across the game world when you use the arrow keys.</p> 
            <h4>Difficulty</h4>
            <p>This allows you to adjust hidden factors within the game to make the game more or less
                difficult.</p>  
            <h4>Dither Always</h4>
            <p>Enable this option if a character should always appear dithered when it is obscured by an object.
                If this setting is disabled, the character is only dithered when the mouse cursor is over it or its
                portrait. Otherwise, the character is not displayed at all.</p> 
            <h4>Weather</h4>
            <p>Enable this option to see weather effects like rain and snow.</p>
            <h4>Gore</h4>
            <p>This toggles on and off the blood and “excessive” damage and death animations in the game.</p>
            <h4>Group Infravision</h4>
            <p>Enable this option if you want infravision to be shown when any of the selected characters have
                infravision. If this option is off, infravision will strictly be shown when only characters with
                infravision are selected.</p>   
            <h4>Rest Until Healed</h4>
            <p>Enable this option to cast healing spells during rest repeatedly until fully healed. Otherwise,
                currently memorized healing spells are cast once on resting.</p> 
            <p><em>Note: Selecting “Rest Until Healed” may cause your party to rest for longer than the normal 8
                hours, as healing spells are re-memorized and cast again as needed.</em></p>
            <h4>Feedback</h4>
            <p>This screen allows you to modify the frequency with which you see markers and locators, as well
                as turn on and off the various messages that come up during the game.</p>
            <h4>Auto-Pause</h4>
            <p>This screen allows you to set various conditions under which the game will pause automatically.
                Using these options can help to give the game a more turn-based feel.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <header>Miscellaneous Gameplay Information</header>
            <p>In addition to the above controls and screens, the following information may be useful to you.</p>
            <h4>Fatigue</h4>
            <p>A character can continue to operate at peak efficiency for 24 hours in game-time (2 hours real-
                time). After that, the characters will start to complain and their attributes begin to suffer. For every four hours beyond this 24-hour mark, the player will receive a –1 luck penalty (–1 to all
                rolls). As soon as the character rests, all penalties will disappear. The amount of time a character
                can function without rest is augmented by a high Constitution score, just as a low Constitution
                will make a character need to take more frequent rest stops.</p>
            <h4>Intoxication</h4>
            <p>A character becomes intoxicated after drinking enough alcoholic beverages. The average
                character will be able to drink about five alcoholic beverages before becoming intoxicated, but
                this amount may vary depending on the character’s Constitution. Intoxicated characters gain a
                morale bonus, but a luck penalty. The greater the level of intoxication, the greater the bonus
                and penalty. The effects of intoxication diminish over time.</p>
            <h4>Infravision</h4>
            <p>Some characters and monsters have the power of infravision. Infravision allows you to see better
                in the dark by revealing the heat of objects and creatures. A character without innate infravision
                can gain the ability through spells or magical equipment. In the dark, creatures revealed with
                infravision will appear to “glow” with a dim red light. Note that apart from the graphical effect
                of creatures being limned in red, this ability has no effect on gameplay.</p>
            <h4>Effects of Wearing Armor</h4>
            <p>Different buttons may be dimmed in the bottom panel depending on what your characters are
                wearing. Even if a multi-class or dual-class wizard is wearing armor, he can still memorize spells,
                but he may not cast these spells until the armor is removed.</p>
