                <p>Characters see a certain distance away using a direct line of sight. This means that they cannot
                    see around a building until they move to the corner and that they cannot see through walls.
                    Areas that cannot be seen remain obscured in darkness until explored; explored areas that are
                    out of sight will be displayed but covered in a layer of shadows. </p>

            <header>Bottom Menu Buttons</header>
            <article>
                <p>Different sets of bottom buttons are displayed depending on whether you select a single
                    character or a group of characters. There are twelve character bottom buttons; these change
                    depending on which single character is selected. Use the F1 through F12 hot keys to quickly
                    select the following options. </p>

            <article>
                <p>These slots correspond to the quick weapon slots on the inventory page. Load a weapon into
                    these slots by equipping it to the corresponding slot on the Inventory screen. R-click on any
                    ranged weapon in a quick slot to select the type of ammunition to use.</p>
                <p>The character’s class determines how many quick weapon slots will be displayed. The number of
                    slots directly corresponds to how many weapons can be equipped on the Inventory screen (4 for
                    Fighters; 3 for other warriors; 2 for all other characters).</p>

            <article>
                <p>The following buttons are displayed only for certain classes.</p>
            </article>
            <h3>Find Traps</h3>
            <p>This is a mode available to Thieves and Monks. If you select an action other than movement for
                that character, this mode ends. This mode also activates a Thief’s Detect Illusions ability.</p>
            <h3>Thieving</h3>
            <p>This action includes pick pocketing, opening locks, and removing traps, depending on the target
                chosen</p>
            <h3>Stealth</h3>
            <p>This is a blend of the Move Silently and Hide in Shadows skills. Thieves can choose this mode
                and, if successful, they become nigh-invisible. Provided a Thief is behind the target, his or her
                next attack, if successful, will be a backstab that causes double, triple, or quadruple damage
                depending on the level of the Thief. Moving into the light or launching an attack can cause
                Stealth to fail. Rangers can also use the Stealth ability but cannot backstab (with the exception of
                the Stalker kit).</p>
            <h3>Turn Undead</h3>
            <p>This is a mode that Clerics and Paladins can choose; the Cleric (or Paladin) persists in turning
                undead until an action other than movement is selected. Clerics in this mode will attempt to
                turn undead creatures; if successful the undead will run away for a time, or they may be
                destroyed if the Cleric is powerful enough. Evil Clerics using this ability may gain control over
                some undead creatures.</p>
            <h3>Cast Spells</h3>
            <p>This ability is usable by any class with the ability to cast spells, such as Mages, Clerics, Druids,
                and—at higher levels—Rangers and Paladins. Clicking this button opens up the memorized
                spell list of the priest or wizard and the priest or wizard can cast a spell from this list.</p>
            <h3>Quick Spells</h3>
            <p>These buttons are configured by R-clicking on the quick spell slot, bringing up a list of all
                currently memorized spells. Once configured, the spell is ready for use at the push of the
                appropriate button or by L-clicking on that slot.</p>
            <h3>Bard Song</h3>
            <p>This ability is usable by Bards; the Bard character begins playing a song that continues until any
                action other than movement is selected for that Bard. While the song is playing, the party’s
                morale and luck are higher.</p>
            <h3>Use Item</h3>
            <p>When L-clicked, this button allows you to use the special abilities of any items you currently
                have equipped, such as cloaks, rings, or helmets.</p>
            <h3>Quick Item</h3>
            <p>Each character has three Quick Item slots (although some characters’ slots might be
                permanently occupied by jewelry or small animals), which allow you to quickly use an item from your inventory such as a wand or potion. You may ready any item in the Quick Item slots
                by dragging the item on the Inventory screen to the corresponding Quick Item slot.</p>
            <h3>Special Abilities</h3>
            <p>This button is used for any characters with special abilities (for example, special abilities for
                certain classes or any special abilities that are gained by your characters during the course of the
                game). If you click on this button, a list of special abilities will be displayed for that character</p>
            <h3>Multi-Character Buttons</h3>
            <p>The following buttons are displayed when more than one character is selected.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Defend</li>
                <li>Dialogue</li>
                <li>Attack</li>
                <li>Stop</li>
                <li>Quick Formation</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Defend</h3>
            <p>Clicking this button directs the currently selected character or characters to defend the selected
                target or area by attacking any enemies targeting that creature or entering that area.</p>
            <h3>Dialogue</h3>
            <p>Clicking this button allows the selected character(s) to initiate dialogue with friendly or neutral
                NPCs. Some hostile NPCs may also allow you to initiate dialogue, but be aware that to speak to
                anyone you must be able to get close to them, which may be dangerous for some less hearty
                adventurers.</p>
            <h3>Attack</h3>
            <p>Clicking this button will direct the selected character(s) to attack the selected creature using any
                weapons currently held in hand.</p>
            <h3>Stop</h3>
            <p>Clicking this button halts all current party actions. This button is useful if you suddenly realize
                that your character is walking into a trap your Thief has discovered.</p>
            <h3>Quick Formation</h3>
            <p>Party members form up in the same order as top down on the character portraits bar (top
                character is first in formation). If fewer than six characters are selected, they will form up to the
                number of characters selected, filling formation slots in order until there are no more
                characters. The formation can be rotated by R-clicking and dragging at the desired destination
                when a group is selected. By default, a number of formations have already been selected.</p>
            <p>Quick formations work the same as quick spells; to change the quick formation displayed in a
                given slot, R-click the slot desired and then select the new formation to use in that slot.</p>
