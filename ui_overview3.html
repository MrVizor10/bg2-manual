                <p>Dialogue occurs with the selected character only; changing the character who is having the

                <p><em>Note: Regardless of who is having the dialogue, reaction adjustments will be based on the
                        “leader” of the group. The “leader” is always the top-most character portrait of all the
                        characters
                        that are present in the area.</em></p>
                <p>There are three sizes for the dialogue window: a two-line size (small), a medium size—the
                    default size for normal play and used to display system messages and game conditions—and a
                    large size which is used when dialogue is being displayed. At any time, you may change the size
                    of this window by pressing the “Page Up” or “Page Down” keys on your keyboard or by pressing
                    the up or down buttons beside the dialogue window.</p>
                <p>There is also a scroll bar at the right of the dialogue window that may be used to scroll up or
                    down in the dialogue queue. Dialogue uses a menu based system where you L-click on what you
                    want to say from a list. What is available to be said varies according to the reaction adjustment
                    and Charisma of the party’s leader.</p>
                <p>You can scroll up using the scroll bar to view previous conversations at any time.</p>

                            Either way, upon ordering a drink, the proprietor may decide to share rumors that
                            he has heard lately. Be careful, however, as your characters can become intoxicated
                            if they drink too much.</p>

                <p>Certain items and containers can be picked up or opened in the game. When you move your
                    cursor over them, they will be highlighted in blue. L-click to access the item or container. When
                    you access the item or container, the Container panel will come up at the bottom of the screen.
                    The left side of the panel shows the items that are on the ground or in the container and the
                    right side is a small portion of the selected character’s inventory. Clicking on items on the left
                    side of the panel moves the items from the ground or container into the character’s inventory. If
                    the character’s inventory is full, the item will not be transferred. Note that this process can be
                    reversed, and items can also be moved from a character’s inventory into a container or onto the
                    ground by L-clicking on them in the right side of this panel.</p>
                <p>Certain containers may also contain stacks of gold. Clicking on these stacks will add the gold to
