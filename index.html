                <p>If you’re reading this guide, it’s likely that you have already installed the game. There are no
                    CDs to insert, remove, and insert again. If you are reading this, congratulations! Installation is
                    complete. </p>
                <p>This guide details the ins and outs of how to play
                    Baldur’s Gate II: Enhanced Edition. Note that
                    it presumes that you are entering our Realms through a “Window,” not an “Apple” or an
                    “Android” or an “iPad.” It therefore explains the default controls for use with a Windows-based
                    game first. Notes on the differences between the PC and iPad versions of the game appear at the
                    end.  </p>
                <p>In the following pages, you will learn how to create your character, how to navigate your way
                    through Faerûn, and how to access the Tutorial, the main game, and the Throne of Bhaal
                    expansion. </p>

            <article>
                <p>When you first open
                    Baldur’s Gate II: Enhanced Edition, you will see a menu with three different
                    choices:
                    Shadows of Amn,
                    Tutorial, and
                    Throne of Bhaal. Select the option you wish to play by
                    clicking the buttons lined in gold. You also can exit the game by clicking Quit Game at the
                    bottom of the screen </p>

        <section id="tutorial" class="main-section">
            <header>Tutorial</header>
            <article>
                <p>For a quick lesson or refresher course, you can use the
                    Tutorial option to play through a short
                    scenario that describes how to play the game. You will then be prompted to create your
                    character, at which point the game will teach you the mechanics and controls. Once the tutorial
                    has been completed, you’ll begin the main
                    Shadows of Amn story. </p>

            <header>Shadows of Amn</header>
            <article>
                <p>Clicking this option will bring you to the
                    Shadows of Amn main menu, where you can start or
                    load a single player or multiplayer game, adjust gameplay or graphics options, or view the in-
                    game cinematics that you have previously seen in the game. This menu will start the main
                    storyline at the beginning of
                    Shadows of Amn. You will be prompted to either create a new
                    character or import an existing one from a saved game or an exported character file. </p>

                <p>Throne of Bhaal starts where
                    Shadows of Amn left off; clicking this option will bring you to the
                    same series of menus as
                    Shadows of Amn, but the game will start after the events of
                    Shadows of
                    Amn, in the Forest of Tethyr. Just like in
                    Shadows of Amn, you will be prompted to either create
                    a new character or import an existing one. </p>
